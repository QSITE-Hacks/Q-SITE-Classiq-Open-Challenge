        "\n",
        "  * States like q = [1, 1] with ancilla_2 = [1, 1] occurred only 3 times, indicating that some evolution paths controlled by the ancilla qubits (for example, [1,1]) were less likely to contribute to the final measured state.\n",

        "  * The algorithm's goal is to simulate the time evolution of the system, and the frequent measurement of states where both position and velocity are high aligns with the expected oscillatory behavior.\n",

        "The output aligns with the expected behavior of the harmonic oscillator and the structure of the quantum algorithm. The frequent occurrence of high position/velocity states and the varying ancilla qubit outcomes indicate that the algorithm is simulating the time evolution of the harmonic oscillator correctly, with projection into the desired subspace. The lower-frequency states represent less probable outcomes, as expected for a quantum system."
